Recognition Science: Basic Number Theory
=========================================

This file proves the fundamental number-theoretic facts underlying
the 45-gap incompatibility that forces the ξ-field.

Key results:
- gcd(8, 45) = 1 (coprimality)
- lcm(8, 45) = 360 (cycle period)
- 45 = 3² × 5 (prime factorization)
